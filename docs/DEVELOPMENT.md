# Development

## Build instructions

### Prerequisites

- [go 1.16 or above](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/)

### Building

```sh
# Build yac for your platform target
make build

# Build yac binaries and archives for all platforms using goreleaser
make build-all

# Build yac and get an interactive docker shell with completion
make build-exec

# Standing in _example directory you can run the following to debug faster
(cd .. && make build-and-link && cd - && ../dist/yac run multi -p template-generator)
```

### Releasing

The following workflow is used for releasing a new `yac` version:

1. Create pull request with changes
2. Pass all tests
3. Squash-merge to main with descriptive commit message
4. Update `Makefile` and `CHANGELOG.md` with correct version, and add all changes to `CHANGELOG.md`
5. Push with commit message `Release vx.y.z`
6. Run `make release`, which will:
   1. Create a git tag with release notes
   2. Trigger a build in Github that builds cross-platform binaries and generates release notes of changes between current and previous tag

## Dependency Graph

Create SVG dependency graphs using graphviz and [goda](https://github.com/loov/goda)

```
goda graph "github.com/alajmo/yac/..." | dot -Tsvg -o res/graph.svg
goda graph "github.com/alajmo/yac:all" | dot -Tsvg -o res/graph-full.svg
```
